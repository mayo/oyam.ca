> Child of Mine, come  
  as you grow in youth  
  you will learn  
  the secret places  
  the cave behind the waterfall  
  the arms of the oak  
  that hold you high  
  the stars so near  
  on a desert ledge  
  ...the important places.
  
> And, as with age, you choose  
  your own way  
  among the many faces  
  of a busy world  
  may you always remember  
  the path that leads back.  
  ...back to the important places.  

 --- Dad to Forest, 1986

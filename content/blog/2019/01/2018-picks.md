At the beginning of this year, I ran across [Alex Burke's](ab) blog, while researching about film scanning. Among loads of other useful posts, I noticed Alex' "The Bets Of ..." posts, where he picks of 9(ish) of his best shots of the year.

I really like this idea. It's a great opportunity to go through all the photos I've taken over the year, remember and re-live some of the memories, as well as take a more critical look at the photos and make purposeful choices.

I like the format of nine shots. It's enough to capture the year, make a concise presentation, yet it's small enough to force some contention and force critical look for the picks. Albeit, I took a slightly different angle and my picks aren't necessarily the best picks, but they are the ones that mean most to me, be it because they are some of the best, or because they recall the best memories.

We took our dog for a walk while visiting relatives, and found this lone alpaca in the field. The alpaca was sensing our dog, so I didn't have much time to grab a shot. It's a little oddly framed, but that's partially why I like it.

It poured for two days straight, but eventually we were rewarded by a beautiful sunset.

These goats are so much fun. I love their fuzzy beards and behinds. Shot on Fuji Pro 400H with Kiev 80.

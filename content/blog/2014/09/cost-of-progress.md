> What is the point of Progress if the food is tasteless, the housing absurd, the work boring, and the earth clobbered with concrete?

> Towards what is Progress? In fact, what on Earth are we doing? No one has even the ghost of a notion.

> Save perhaps a few simple-minded people who live to smell flowers, listen to the sea, watch trees in the wind, & cuddle with a lovely woman.

[180&deg; South][180south] is a documentary about Jeff Johnson's inspiring
adventure to Patagonia, Chile, following in the footsteps of Yvon Chouinard
and Doug Tompkins. Instead of driving down south, though, Jeff sets out on a
set of adventures, including becoming a crew on sail boat and ship wrecking
off Easter Island and surfing the longest wave of his life. Along the way he
meets interesting people, tells inspiring stories, and shows breathtaking
images from places others only wish they could visit.

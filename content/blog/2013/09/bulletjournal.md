For the list-makers, the note-takers, the Post-It note pilots, the track-keepers, and the dabbling doodlers. Bullet journal is for those who feel there are few platforms as powerful as the blank paper page. It's an analog system for the digital age that will help you organize the present, record the past, and plan for the future.

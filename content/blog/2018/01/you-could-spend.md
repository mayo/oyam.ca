[You could spend thousands of dollars and time to build machine that can run Lightroom decently](https://www.dpreview.com/articles/2050636398/how-one-photographer-built-the-ultimate-lightroom-pc-for-photo-editing) (and hope it gets optimizations, because it's still not good enough), or you could just switch to more sane tools that run much faster on older hardware (like Capture One). *sigh*

The new GitTower 3.x update is great, but unfortunately I can no longer recommend it as an alternative client. With the new release comes new subscription licensing -- Don't get me wrong, I'd be more than happy to pay for new versions or features, or even annualy, however, I can't get behind a subscription model that disables the software completely when I stop paying. I would have no problem if it froze in time and stopped getting updates, but not the licensing model fournova chose.

What am I paying for, really? There are no services fournova has to run to make GitTower work, and I'm already paying full price for the software.

I'm switching back to GitTower 2.x. You can download the old version from the [Release Notes](https://www.git-tower.com/release-notes/).

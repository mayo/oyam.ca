[My Grandfather’s Memory Book](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/opinion/family-grandfathers-memories.html) is a touching story that brought back memories of my grandfather who was industrial designer, painter and cartoonist. My brother and I grew up browsing through his design notes, watching him draw cartoons for publications, and paint. He didn’t keep journals, but we have paintings, stacks of cartoons, and paper toys he made for us.

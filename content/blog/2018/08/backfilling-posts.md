I have bunch of old posts I've started, but procrastinated on for a while, some a few years old. Now that I'm finishing some of them, I'm torn whether I should backdate them, or publish them as new. I like backdating because then the posts fit within the overall timeline, but for some reason it feels "wrong" to do so.

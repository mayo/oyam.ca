Sherry Turkle's contribution to NY Times Sunday Review, adapted from her book "Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age"

> In solitude we find ourselves; we prepare ourselves to come to conversation with something to say that is authentic, ours. If we can’t gather ourselves, we can’t recognize other people for who they are. If we are not content to be alone, we turn others into the people we need them to be. If we don’t know how to be alone, we’ll only know how to be lonely.

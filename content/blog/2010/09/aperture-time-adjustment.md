I've always missed decent way of adjusting photo time in Aperture. The normal `Batch Change` only allows you to change time-zones, which is almost always useless if you are like me and don't adjust your camera for daylight savings, or have camera with wrong time.

I've just noticed there is `Metadata` > `Adjust Time`. It can change time to arbitrary values, it can change the time on master image, and it works on multiple photos (select multiple photos, change time on current pick, and it will change all selected photos).

How nice, I wonder why this isn't exposed in the `Batch Change` window.

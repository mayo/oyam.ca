## Switching to yet another static generator

Until recently this site was generated by Hana, a custom built static site generator. I was adding features to Hana that were specific in how I wanted the site to behave. To avoid cornering the site to specific features, and more importantly, save time on tool maintenance, I decided to switch the site generation to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

As part of the change, I'm slightly updating the design, removing features that were no longer serving their purpose, as well as adding usability enhancements like more indices and cleaning up navigation. Some 404s may happen and I'll try to back-fill redirects that I've missed.

## Learning Rust

I've been eyeing Rust for a while, and I took the opportunity to dive in while I was laid off with bit extra time to spare. It's quite the adjustment, but I've been enjoying it immensly and it has reminded me how much I've missed deep dive into code and learning new tools. 

## Fan controller

I have a regular kitchen fan with four buttons (faster, slower, lights, power) and simple display with time and fan indication. I've been working on redesigning and replacing the controller and circuit with a ESP32 based chip and integration with ESPHome/HomeAssistant.

<h1>It's gone!</h1>

<p>The page you were looking for has gone missing.</p>

<p>Below are some ages old articles that still seem to be popular or get referenced. Couple of them have been rewritten and linked back to the current site, the others have been archived as they are most likely no longer relevant. If you don't see what you're looking for in the list and you're terribly sad about this, please let me know, and I'll see what can be done.</p>
